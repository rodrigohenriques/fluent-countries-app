# fluent-countries-app
This app shows how to use [Fluent](https://github.com/fluentio/Fluent) and RxJava2 to manage your app state. 

## Next Steps
- Make country list scroll smoother (maybe using Glide or SVG images)
- Add sort options (population, gini and area)
- Add filter options (region, sub region, language and regional block)
